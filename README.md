# Capistrano Local Precompile

The slowest part in a rails application is in the assets compiling. So let's throw it out! This gem adds a local build of assets and packs right on your machine and then uploads all the files to the server.

## Usage

Add local-precompile to your Gemfile:

```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'local_precompile', '~> 0.3.1', require: false
end
```

Remove any gems associated with assets, like:

```ruby
gem 'capistrano-faster-assets'
gem 'quiet_assets'
```

Then add the following line to your `Capfile`:

```ruby
require 'local_precompile/capistrano'
```

Remove the following line from your `Capfile`:

```ruby
require 'capistrano/rails/assets'
```

Change webpacker compile options in `config/webpacker.yml` to false:

```yaml
staging:
  compile: false
```
```yaml
production:
  compile: false
```

Remove node modules folder from `set :linked_dirs` your `config/deploy.rb`.

Here's the full set of configurable options:

```ruby
set :precompile_env             # default: fetch(:rails_env) || 'production'
set :assets_dir                 # default: "public/assets"
set :packs_dir                  # default: "public/packs"
set :rsync_cmd                  # default: "rsync -av --delete"
```

Capistrano supports **dry run** mode. In that case the `rsync` command will not actually be run but only shown in stdout:

```
cap production deploy --dry-run
```
